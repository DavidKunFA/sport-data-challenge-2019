# Sport Data Challenge 2019

The _Sport Data Challenge 2019_ is organized by [Sport Data Valley](https://sportdatavalley.nl) and [Amsterdam Data Science](https://amsterdamdatascience.nl/).

This repository contains the data (and the code to retrieve it) for the challenge, as well as some other instructions

## Data
The race results and weather data can be found in [this](data) directory.
Each subdirectory there contains the data files as well as a data_dictionairy.md file that explains the format of the data and some remarks.

At this (TODO) link there is more data available that can only be accessed during the Sport Data Challenge and that has to be deleted at the end of the Challenge.
Instructions on how to use the data and the password is available from the organization.

## Slack workspace
The organization will use this (TODO) Slack workspace for communication during the day.
You are free to create a private Slack channel within this workspace for your team communication.


## Contributing
Feel free to submit a pull request if you spot errors in the data or code.

The results of your team at this Sport Data Challenge may also be contributed back to this repo.
To do this, create a subdirectory of the [results](results/) directory with your team name (e.g. `results/your_team_name/`) and create a PR.
